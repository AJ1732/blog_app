**# Blog App**

**## Overview**

This project is a simple Blog web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete blog posts. 

**## Features**

- **Post Creation:** Users can create new blog posts with rich content using Markdown formatting.
- **Post Viewing:** The home page showcases a list of all posts, enabling users to easily browse and read them.
- **Post Update/Delete:** Individual posts can be edited or deleted as needed, providing flexibility in content management.
- **Styling:** The application is designed with a focus on user experience, featuring a clean and responsive interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

**## Technologies Used**

- **Node.js & Express.js:** Node.js serves as the JavaScript runtime environment, while Express.js is used to create the web server and handle routing and middleware.
- **EJS:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is employed as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML content based on the application's state.

**## Additional Information**

- **No Database:** In this version, posts do not persist between sessions as a database is not implemented.
- **Focus on Styling:** Significant attention has been devoted to styling to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Prerequisites
  Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or above recommended) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.
